# Multiple Precision Arithmetic & Cryptographic Library

The object of this project was to develop libraries that can serve as an extension of C and C++ for calculating with large integers. This needed a complete rewriting of the traditional arithmetic functions that are used in modern days computer by using much more advanced algorithms.

The libraries produced allow the end user to calculate with numbers as large as 4096 bits in a very efficient and transparent way by overloading the classical C++ operators +, -, *, /, etc.

Also, there are libraries in C/C++ that implements some Cryptographic algorithms such as RSA, ElGamal, Rijndael (AES) and some hash functions.
